Welcome to the Meme Generator project! ðŸŽ‰

About the Project:
This is a React-based application I developed as part of my 2024 journey to revise core React concepts. The project fetches meme templates from an API and allows users to create custom memes by adding personalized text to the images.

Features:

1)API Integration: Fetches meme templates dynamically from a meme API.

2)Text Customization: Add top and bottom text to your memes with live previews.



Core React Concepts Used:

1)Components: Modular and reusable UI components.

2)Props and State: Managing dynamic data and user inputs.

3)Event Handling: Interactive features like text editing.

4)Conditional Rendering: Showing different elements based on user actions.

5)Hooks: Leveraging useState and useEffect for managing component lifecycle and state.

Why This Project?
As 2024 begins, I wanted to revisit and strengthen my React skills. This project leverages both basic and advanced React concepts and integrates an API, making it a practical and enjoyable learning exercise.
Feel free to explore, clone, and contribute! ðŸ˜Š
Happy Meming!
